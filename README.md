# Crowdfunding-ETL
## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to:
* Extract data
* Transform and Clean Data
* Create an ERD and a Table Schema and then load the data
* Complete an SQL Analysis

## Overview

The company received a new dataset that contained information about the backers who pledged to the live projects. Independent Funding wanted both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

We used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, we extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. 

Then, we used the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. 

Finally, we uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. 

We performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
